# racket-salty-crypto

Racket bindings to a selection of cryptographic libraries loosely based around
[NaCl](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/) and what followed it.

 - [`libsodium`](https://libsodium.org/), a mature and well-supported library originally built
   around NaCl.

 - [`libb2`](https://github.com/BLAKE2/libb2), support for BLAKE2b, BLAKE2s etc.
